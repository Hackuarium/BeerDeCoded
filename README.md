# BeerDeCoded
BeerDeCoded is a project carried out by members of Hackuarium, a Swiss not-for-profit association that supports unconventional research ideas and promote the public understanding of science by making laboratory tools more accessible. The goal of BeerDeCoded is to extend scientific knowledge about beer, while discussing issues related to personal genomics, food technology, and their role in society with the general public. Two years ago, a crowdfunding campaign provided funding for the first stage of the project. Reaching out through this channel also allowed to collect 120 beer samples from 20 countries.
